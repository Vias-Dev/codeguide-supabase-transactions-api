# Tech Stack Document

## 1. Frontend Technologies
Although the primary focus of this project is on building a secure, API-first transactional backend, the codebase includes a modern frontend foundation. Here’s how each piece contributes to a clean, responsive user interface:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
  - File-based routing with `app/` directory for pages and API route handlers.
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box.
- **React 18**
  - Core library for building interactive, component-based UIs.
- **TypeScript**
  - Strong typing across components, props, and data fetching logic minimizes runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling without writing custom CSS classes.
- **shadcn/ui**
  - Accessible, pre-built React components styled with Tailwind, accelerates UI development.
- **Framer Motion**
  - Declarative animations for smooth page transitions and micro-interactions.
- **TanStack React Query**
  - Client-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization for UI state.
- **React Hook Form & Zod**
  - Lightweight form state management combined with schema validation for robust, user-friendly forms.
- **Sonner**
  - Toast notifications for user feedback on actions like form submissions or errors.
- **clsx & tailwind-merge**
  - Utility libraries for conditionally combining CSS class names and merging Tailwind classes.

By combining these tools, the project ensures a fast, accessible, and maintainable user interface that can grow into a developer dashboard or admin portal when needed.

## 2. Backend Technologies
This project uses a modern, full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript backend centered on Next.js API routes and Supabase:

- **Next.js Route Handlers (App Router)**
  - RESTful API endpoints under `app/api/`, each implemented as a standalone `route.ts` file.
  - Built-in request/response abstractions with support for middleware.
- **Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**
  - Intercepts all `/api/*` requests to extract and validate the custom `x-api-key` header.
  - Attaches authenticated user context to incoming requests before they reach route handlers.
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
  - Primary database and serverless backend service.
  - Manages tables for users, API keys, balances, transactions, and mutations.
  - Uses Row Level Security (RLS) for fine-grained access controls.
- **Supabase Clients**
  - **`utils/supabase/admin.ts`**: Service-role client for privileged operations (bypasses RLS).
  - **`utils/supabase/server.ts`**: Regular server-side client for standard queries.
- **Supabase RPC (Stored Functions)**
  - Encapsulates multi-step transaction logic (debit, credit, ledger entries) in a single atomic call.
  - Guarantees all-or-nothing behavior to maintain data consistency.
- **Clerk**
  - User authentication and profile management for any future UI.
  - Can be swapped or extended if you prefer purely API key–based auth.
- **Stripe (Integration Patterns)**
  - Included as an example of secure server-side integrations and webhook handling.
  - Patterns for event-driven data updates (e.g., subscription status changes).
- **OpenAI API**
  - Basic integration scaffold for AI-powered features.

Together, these backend technologies provide a secure, scalable foundation for handling high-volume transactional workflows and user management.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment
To keep the system reliable, scalable, and easy to deploy, this project relies on established DevOps practices:

- **Hosting Platform**
  - **Vercel** (default for Next.js) or any Node.js hosting provider such as Netlify or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Zero-config deployments with global CDN, automatic SSL, and edge functions support.
- **Database Hosting**
  - **Supabase** managed Postgres instance with automated backups and scaling.
- **Version Control**
  - **Git** hosted on **GitHub**, enabling pull requests, code reviews, and branch protections.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - **GitHub Actions** (or Vercel’s built-in pipelines) to run linting, type checks, and tests on every push.
  - Automatic deployments to production on changes to the `main` branch.
- **Environment and Secrets Management**
  - `.env` files locally and encrypted environment variables in Vercel/GitHub for Supabase keys, Clerk credentials, and Stripe secrets.
- **Automated Database Migrations**
  - SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/` checked into Git for versioned schema changes.

These infrastructure choices ensure fast iteration, safe rollbacks, and predictable production performance.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations
The project enhances its functionality by integrating with best-in-class external services:

- **Clerk**
  - Full-featured user management (sign-up, sign-in, multi-factor authentication).
- **Stripe**
  - Subscription and payment processing, plus webhook-driven data sync.
- **OpenAI**
  - API integration for potential AI features (e.g., content generation, analytics insights).

Each integration is designed with security best practices (server-side secret management, webhooks verification) and follows clear patterns for maintainability.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations
To protect users and maintain fast response times, the tech stack incorporates multiple safeguards and optimizations:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - **API Key Middleware:** Validates `x-api-key` against the `api_keys` table before any route logic executes.
  - **Clerk Tokens (optional):** For browser-driven UI flows, Clerk manages secure sessions and JWTs.
  - **Supabase RLS:** Ensures that client-side queries can only access permitted rows unless using the service-role key.
- **Data Protection**
  - Secrets stored in environment variables, never checked into source control.
  - HTTPS enforced by default on hosting platforms.
- **Atomic Transactions**
  - Use of Supabase RPC functions to wrap debit, credit, and ledger insertions in a single database transaction.
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - **Edge Caching** via Next.js and Vercel for static assets and non-sensitive routes.
  - **React Query** for efficient client-side state and cache management.
  - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** for pages that can be statically generated.
- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - Structured server-side logging (e.g., with **Pino**) for all transaction attempts, successes, and errors.
  - Error tracking via services like Sentry or Logflare.
- **Testing Strategy**
  - **Unit Tests:** Vitest or Jest for utility functions.
  - **Integration Tests:** Endpoint tests that validate HTTP responses and side effects in the database.

These measures help prevent unauthorized access, detect issues early, and deliver a consistently smooth user experience.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary
